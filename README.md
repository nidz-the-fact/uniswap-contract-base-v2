**Advice**: You should deploy a contract. 1.[`UniswapV2Factory`](https://github.com/nidz-the-fact/uniswap-contract-base-v2/tree/main/UniswapV2Factory) first and then 2.[`UniswapV2Router02`](https://github.com/nidz-the-fact/uniswap-contract-base-v2/tree/main/UniswapV2Router02) <br>
Additional Wrapped Token (WETH) configuration is also required. If you don't have it go this [Wrapped Ether](https://github.com/nidz-the-fact/wrapped-token)
